# Python for fun
Scripts wrote to try something new or showcase a problem I had to solve.

## Here is the current list of what I did:
- RetrieveWordsURL.py: A script that retrieves words from a URL and print them.
- RobotSampleProgram.py: A small example showing how to use a Meca500 robot with Python 3.
